# 📖OOP school library <a name="about-project"></a>

**OOP school library** In this project, I start building my school library app. In this initial step, I implement the classes to represent students and teachers. I also finished creating the remaining classes for our school library and created the associations between them. Also created a form of UI for school library app, this way it can be invoked as an executable and not something you use in IRB exclusively.
